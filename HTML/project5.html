            <pre>                 This topic is one of my favorites because (selfish or not)
                I am enjoying my own company
                all the time. And I know you could do it too.

                Enjoying your own company has nothing to do with being single or 
                lonely. 
                Yet, it has everything to do with trusting that you need no one
                to be happy,
                even if you already have someone. Does that make any sense?
